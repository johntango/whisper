Hi, my name is John Williams. I'm a Professor of Information Engineering at MIT.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I teach two courses, one in engineering computation and data science,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and the other in architecting and engineering software systems.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And it's been a real pleasure to collaborate with Boeing on developing these courses.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
For many years I was Director of the MIT Auto ID Lab where the Internet of Things was invented.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We thought at that time our problem was a hardware problem.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We had RFID chips that we tried to read and the distance that we can read them wasn't that great.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it turned out our problem really was how to build a system to move that data and make it visible around the world.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So Eric Schmidt says that since the beginning of time until 2003 there was only 5 exabytes of data created.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Today we create that data in just a few hours.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So the problem is how to change that data into business value.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And in these courses we're covering all the stages that you'll be going through.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're going to leverage the tools and the techniques from web computing through the cloud to AI and machine learning.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And by leveraging these we think that today we can build sophisticated systems that can handle real-time data that give us real business value.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So we think you're going to learn a lot in these courses and I'll be seeing you online. Bye for now.
