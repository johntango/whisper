Hi, my name is John Williams. I'm a Professor of Information Engineering at MIT.

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
I teach two courses, one in engineering computation and data science,

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
and the other in architecting and engineering software systems.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
And it's been a real pleasure to collaborate with Boeing on developing these courses.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
For many years I was Director of the MIT Auto ID Lab where the Internet of Things was invented.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
We thought at that time our problem was a hardware problem.

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
We had RFID chips that we tried to read and the distance that we can read them wasn't that great.

00:39.000 --> 00:48.000
But it turned out our problem really was how to build a system to move that data and make it visible around the world.

00:49.000 --> 01:02.000
So Eric Schmidt says that since the beginning of time until 2003 there was only 5 exabytes of data created.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
Today we create that data in just a few hours.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
So the problem is how to change that data into business value.

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
And in these courses we're covering all the stages that you'll be going through.

01:22.000 --> 01:31.000
We're going to leverage the tools and the techniques from web computing through the cloud to AI and machine learning.

01:31.000 --> 01:41.000
And by leveraging these we think that today we can build sophisticated systems that can handle real-time data that give us real business value.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
So we think you're going to learn a lot in these courses and I'll be seeing you online. Bye for now.
