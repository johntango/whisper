0	6000	Hi, my name is John Williams. I'm a Professor of Information Engineering at MIT.
6000	11000	I teach two courses, one in engineering computation and data science,
11000	15000	and the other in architecting and engineering software systems.
15000	21000	And it's been a real pleasure to collaborate with Boeing on developing these courses.
21000	27000	For many years I was Director of the MIT Auto ID Lab where the Internet of Things was invented.
27000	31000	We thought at that time our problem was a hardware problem.
31000	39000	We had RFID chips that we tried to read and the distance that we can read them wasn't that great.
39000	48000	But it turned out our problem really was how to build a system to move that data and make it visible around the world.
49000	62000	So Eric Schmidt says that since the beginning of time until 2003 there was only 5 exabytes of data created.
62000	68000	Today we create that data in just a few hours.
68000	75000	So the problem is how to change that data into business value.
75000	82000	And in these courses we're covering all the stages that you'll be going through.
82000	91000	We're going to leverage the tools and the techniques from web computing through the cloud to AI and machine learning.
91000	101000	And by leveraging these we think that today we can build sophisticated systems that can handle real-time data that give us real business value.
101000	108000	So we think you're going to learn a lot in these courses and I'll be seeing you online. Bye for now.
